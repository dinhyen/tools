<h3><em>Cancannesque</em></h3>

How do you say resort in French? Why, Cannes of course. We got there the last day of the Film Festival. Big mistake, because being stuck in traffic wasn't part of the day's itinerary. We got to drive by the red-carpeted entrance of the main venue, a good thing because the road was closed to traffic soon after that. We managed to get out by car, though, but I got a yelling from France's finest for running a yellow light (I got out by explaining that I was a stupid American driver). Michael Moore won a Palme d'Or here, but he was nowhere to be seen. I also came by the famous Côte d'Azur beaches, but let's leave it at that :)
