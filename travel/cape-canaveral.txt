<h1>Cape Canaveral</h1>
<h3><em>Three, two, one, blastoff!</em></h3>
Home to the Kennedy Space Center, where America's space shuttles and other spacecraft take off for the stars. A visit to the KSC is both educational and entertaining. The science and technology on display here are awe-inspiring, and the history behind America's space program are fascinating and at times uplifting. This place is a boon for anyone who'se ever curious about what's out there beyond our little planet.
