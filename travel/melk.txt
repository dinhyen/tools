<h1>Melk</h1>
<h3><em>Marvelous Melk</em></h3>

I put Melk on my itinerary after seeing a photo of this spiral staircase taken by another photographer. The abbey dwarfed my highest expectations. As you can imagine, this splendiferous Baroque gem left an unforgettable impression.

Last visit: 2003
Pros: Stunningly magnificent
Cons: Possible long lines, tour groups vying for limited space
In a nutshell: A semi-religious experience
