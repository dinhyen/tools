<h1>Paris</h1>
<h2><em>The city of lights</em></h2>

It'd be hard to come up with an adjective that hasn't been used to describe Paris. The first time I came here in 1999, I shot 14 rolls of film in one week. However I had only a manual Canon AT-1 with a fixed 50mm lens that turned out to be defective (it leaked light, ruining most of the photos). The second time around I was determined to do a better job. But it turned out my stay in Paris, all of 3 days, bookended our trip to central Europe, so I wasn't able to do much either. I guess a better effort has to wait until next time.

Shooting the Eiffel tower at night is at the top of my wishlist. The problem with that is sunset in Paris is at 10:30pm! Throw in the transit strike, which meant train service was spotty at best, and trying to get home at Place d'Italie around midnight wasn't an attractive proposition. But I'm glad I finally got this out of the way :)

Looking toward Montmartre and Sacre Coeur from atop the Arc de Triomphe.

<h3>Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel</h3>
This triumphal arch, between the Louvre and the Jardin des Tuileries, was built at the beginning of the 19th century and dedicated to the glory and accomplishments Napoleon I.

<h3>The Jardin des Tuileries</h3>
In Paris, even a park is turned into something superlative. This sculpture garden in front of the Louvre can be quite a spectacle under favorable lighting, such as during sunset. In the background is the Luxor obelisk of Place de la Concorde, bisecting the Arc de Triomphe.

<h3>Montmartre</h3>

<h3>Basilique Sacré-Cœur</h3>

 <h3>Palais de Chaillot</h3>
 The Palais de Chaillot, across the Seine from the Eiffel tower, offers excellent vantage point of the Paris landmark. It was originally designed as a venue for art exhibitions. Now it's filled with skaters and rollerbladers and, at twilight, sunset chasers.

<h3>Pont Alexandre III</h3>
This Belle Epoque masterpiece is an opulent homage to Russia's Tsar, one of France's allies in the Franco-Prussian war. The bridge leads from the Esplanade des Invalides to the Rive Droite.

<h3>Notre Dame</h3>

This pensive gargoyle has a name, though it escapes me at the moment.

<h3>Hôtel des Invalides</h3>

Originally intended as a hospital for the sick and the wounded of France's military campaigns, now it is a temple to France's military might. The magnificent golden dome, visible throughout Paris, provides a fitting crown for the final resting place of Napoleon.

The dome of the Hotel des Invalides is quite a sight. Napoleon's tomb is located underneath the dome.

Who's behind a cage?  Them, or us?

Comrades in arms.

<h3>Montmartre</h3>

Pros: The most splendid metropolis in the world
Cons: Frequent transit strikes, yikes!
In a nutshell: Planning my honeymoon here ;)
