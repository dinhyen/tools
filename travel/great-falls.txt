<h1>Great Falls</h1>
<h3><em>An urban wonder</em></h3>
It's a wonder that such untamed wilderness can exist in such close proximity to a large urban center. At Great Falls, VA, the fast flowing Potomac tumbles, thrashes and rolls over rugged rocky ledges on its way to the nation's capital, where it becomes a languid body of water quiet enough to reflect the cherry blossoms on its banks. The turbulent waters of Great Falls are apparently a beckon for die-hard kaykers, a few of whom can usually be seen trying to paddle upstream.
