<h1>Death Valley National Park</h1>

The syrupy ridges and canyons of Zabriskie Point.

Here in this forbidding place with the ominous name, home to the hottest place on the planet, beauty can be found. You'll only have to find it.

Amazingly, the valley is only 2.5 hours from the hustles and bustles of Las Vegas. Most people come here in the winter. Maybe it's just me, when we were there in August, the dry heat didn't feel too bad at all. Your mileage may vary, but make sure your car has a working A/C.

Sand dunes. Unfortunately they are rather bland and shapeless in the noon sun.

The reddish brown color of the soil can be startling.
