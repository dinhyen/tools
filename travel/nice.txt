<h1>Nice</h1>
<h3><em>Nice Nice</em></h3>

How do you like the super-clever title? I'll bet NOONE has ever thought of that one!

We stayed one whole week about 15 minutes away from Nice. We also had one week to explore the whole of Provence. Sigh, again I found myself not giving enough time to this lovely jewel of the Mediterranean. As Ahhnold would say, "I'll be back".

If you compare English weather to this picture, you can see why the English loved this place, and hence imparted this seaside walkway its moniker. In fact it's easy to see that not just the English but everyone else would love it.

Art deco lovers rejoice, because Nice is full of splendid examples.
