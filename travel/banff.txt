<h1>Banff National Park</h1>
<h2><em>Gem of the Rockies</em></h2>

My puny page won't be able to do justice to this gem of the Canadian Rockies, indeed of the planet. Canada's first national park, Banff is also a World Heritage site, a well-deserved recognition.

The Canadian Rockies is a beautiful and harmonious collage of lofty mountains, vast glacial ice sheets, crystal clear blue lakes, rolling alpine meadows, precipitous gorges and canyons, steaming hot springs, and fantastic hoodoos. But all these would be mere scenery, not untamed wilderness, were it not for the fact that this is also home to a great many animals large and small. Herds of elks and caribous roam the plains, while big-horn sheep cling to sheer mountain sides and grizzlies and black bears lumber in the forest.

Banff is truly an amazing place that would take many a visit to truly be appreciated. This is my attempt at making a sketch worthy of its majesty.

<h3>Johnston Canyon</h3>

Johnston Canyon is on the Bow Valley Parkway about half-way between Banff and Lake Louise. The hiking trail snake along Johnston Canyon, formed when glaciers retreated north at the end of the Ice Age.

The canyon can be steep at places, requiring the trail to hug around cliff walls on metal supports. The quick-rushing water go over many spectacular waterfalls, the main ones being Lower Falls and Upper Falls.

Lower Falls is only about 1 km from the head of the trail. A wide, powerful cascades 20-m in height, Lower Falls can be admired from a platform right below the falls. The platform is accessible via a short tunnel through the side of the rocks. You'll be sure to get wet.

Upper Falls is another 3 km away, but well worth the moderate hike. Along the way you'll see several waterfalls and a lush landscape covered with moss and ferns. Upper Falls is a majestic cascades that drop 40 meters into the mossy gorge below. The viewing platform is suspended over the gorge and may be a challenge for the acrophobic.

<h3>Lake Louise</h3>

The mirror-like Lake Louise is famous around the world. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day so we'd have to catch the reflection next time.

Few places on earth offers a more stunning backdrop for rowing.

<h3>Chateau Lake Louise</h3>

The famous hotel is an attraction in its own right.

<h3>Lake Moraine</h3>

Lake Moraine, not far from Lake Louise, is perhaps not as well known as its counterpart, but no less spectacular. The lofty snow-covered peaks provide a stunning backdrop for the crystal-clear lake. The famous reflection is best caught on a clear morning but unfortunately this we missed too :(

You can kayak on Lake Louise too, but the sheer mountain sides which wall in Lake Moraine make it just a little more spectacular.

<h3>Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel</h3>

Well, we couldn't have afforded to check Banff Springs from the inside, but it's surely a well-known landmark that shouldn't be missed.

<h3>Lake Minnewanka</h3>
 
 Lake Minnewanka is on the other side of the Trans-Canada highway from town. It's a popular recreational area with not only breathtaking view but which will give you a good chance of running into wildlife (actually that's true all over Banff, but I got lucky not once but twice near Lake Minnewanka).

<h3>Take frequent stops</h3>

When driving in Banff, whether it's the Trans-Canada or Highway 1A or a smaller road, take advantage of the numerous roadside pullouts. The view is spectacular anywhere you stop!

<h3>Banff vicinity</h3>

Banff is vast, it's hard to know where to begin. In and around the town of Banff there are many scenic drives and trails that will afford spectacular views. So lace up those boots and hike.

<h3>They're eating me alive</h3>

I'm of course referring to the swarms of ravenous mosquitoes that patrol open areas. They were so numerous that they blocked out the sun. Okay, so it was a little exaggeration. But the mosquitoes were so tenacious that they'd stick around, literally, until they become so overly engorged that they fall off on their own, or until a well-placed backhand temporarily provides respite. I was never more afraid of West Nile virus in my life!

Keep wildlife wild.

Last visit: July 2002
Pros: Scenery unmatched else where on earth; accessibility
In a nutshell: If you only see something once in your life, make it Banff
