<h1>Fontainebleau</h1>
<h3><em>Chateau-land</em></h3>

In retrospect, I still have a hard time believing that we had driven the 1100 km from Nice to Rouen in just one day, and yet also managed to make a detour in Fontainebleau. Fortunately the chateau was closing just as we got there, otherwise we might never have made it to Rouen :)
