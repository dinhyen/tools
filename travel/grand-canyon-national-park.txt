<h1>Grand Canyon National Park</h1>
<h3><em>Grandest sight on earth</em></h3>
Breath-taking, awe-inspiring, add your favorite superlative here. Not much else can be said about the Grand Canyon that hasn't already been said. So go there and see it for yourself.

Watch the sunset from Hopi Point. Many places along the South Rim, indeed anywhere along the rim, will let you be spectator to one of the most spectacular sunsets on earth. My favorite happens to be at Hopi Point. Get there early to get a good spot and don't forget your tripod. In the off-peak season, generally November to March, you can drive your car along the rim road. The rest of the year you'd have to take a bus in order to protect the fragile environment from excessive traffic. I've yet to hike to the bottom, but that's on the list.
