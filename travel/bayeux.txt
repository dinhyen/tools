<h1>Bayeux</h1>
<h3><em>Blue</em></h3>

We passed by Bayeux on the way back to Haute-Normandie from the D-Day beaches. It was already past 20h, yet in this part of Europe in the summer, the sun was still high in the sky and the air was pleasantly warm. Bathed in the golden light, the 800-year old towers of the Bayeux cathedral shone like the sun against the deepest blue sky. It was a most impresive and memorable sight.

This intricate and exotic-looking tower could have been of Elvish construct.

In a nutshell: A pleasant base for your exploration of Basse-Normandie
