<h3><em>Tiny Samson</em></h3>

Having just crossed the Pont de Normandie, we decided to come to this tiny promontory to get a good look at it. Well, we saw something all right in the fog.

Completed in 1995, the Normandy bridge was the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world at the time, until it was surpassed by another in Hiroshima.
