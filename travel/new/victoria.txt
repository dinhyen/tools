Victoria can be said to be a corner of the Empire in the Western hemisphere. Certainly afternoon tea at the Empress hotel and the double-deckers, among other things, are a testament to this. Nevertheless the ubiquitous verdure reminds us that this is also a corner of the Pacific Northwest. And so Victoria is a harmonious blend of architecture and green space, of antiquity and modernism, of Old World and New World, of West and.. further West.

A visit to Butchart Gardens is apparently de rigueur for tourists.

The very Victorian Empress Hotel.

Parliament Building
This remarkable structure is the most beautiful in town.

The Empress Hotel - Victoria
This elegant Victoria landmark looks onto the waterfront and is worth a visit even if you don't plan to stay there.

Butchart Gardens - Victoria
There are several similar recommendations already, but I thought I'd add my own to the mix. Butchart Gardens leaves no stones unturned, literally, in turning this already lush landscape into a floral paradise. The explosions of colors can be overwhelming. Thankfully there's also the peaceful Japanese Garden, where you can catch your breath before diving into the sea of flowers out there again.
