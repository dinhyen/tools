Yosemite is perhaps immortalized by Ansel Adams' works. In those black and white photographs, Yosemite appears almost mythical, a place that exists only in the imagination. 

But it's very real, and so is its beauty. One could a whole lifetime here and still not bore of it. In the Tuolumne Meadows Visitor Centers there is a memorial to a long-time park ranger who had spent most of his adult years here. Many would not find it unbelievable.

Yosemite is the most popular national park in the US. It's also very large and require a lengthy stay just to get a grasp of all the sights, much less to fully appreciate them. Unfortunately Yosemite was on the tail end of our road trip, and we were only able to make a cursory trip. Yosemite will merit a trip of its own next time.
