Marble and blossoms
If possible, visit Washington during Cherry Blossoms season, typically late March through mid-April. This is when the Mall and vicinities are at their most glorious.

Washington should be at least familiar to any American who watches TV or movies -- I guess that means everybody :) Everything is here, conveniently located close to each other, so in on swoop you'll be able to visit more national landmarks than any other place in the country. For Americans, the Mall and the Smithsonian probably should be at the top of their list of places to visit.
