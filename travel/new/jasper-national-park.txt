The Icefield Parkway from Banff NP to Jasper NP is probably the longest road I've ever taken. That's because I was tempted to pull off the road at every turn to immerse in the breathtaking vistas.

Jasper NP is the largest of Canada's Rocky Mountain parks. The "typical" scenery here are soaring mountains, broad valleys, and mirror-like lakes. The massive glaciers of the Columbia Icefield offers a glimpse at what it must have been like in the Ice Age. And of course animals inhabitants here probably outnumber humans. There are much to be explored and discovered here. I only wish I had a few years' time and 36-hour days to do them :)

The second bridge

The precipitous gorges of Maligne Canyon induces awe, not to mention vertigo.

Athabasca falls' thunderous roar leaves little doubt that water is nature's most effective carving tool.

Pros and Cons
Pros:Some of the grandest vistas on the planet
Cons:No matter how much time you've spent, you probably haven't spent enough.
