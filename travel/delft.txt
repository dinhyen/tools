<h1>Delft</h1>

Delft is famous for its distinctive porcelain, of course. The town with its cobblestoned alleys, narrow canals and slender footbridges is very picturesque. It was my favorite Dutch town on our trip. I was pleasantly surprised to see the Technical University. In the early days of the web, tudelft.nl was a well-known internet address.
