<h1>Calgary</h1>
<h3><em>O Calgary</em></h3>

After listening to endless hockey talks about Calgary being a small-market team, I had envisioned the town as a rural backwater. Instead, while driving into Calgary from Lethbridge, we were greeted by a modern metropolis complete with gleaming high-rises, sprawling strip malls and vicious traffic jams.

Maybe it's just a Canadian thing, but the streets look just a little cleaner, and traffic a little less chaotic than those in a comparable American city.

Calgary looks like a laid-back, unassuming kind of place. For us, it's also the gateway to Banff and the Canadian Rockies.

<h3>Temple of Heaven, or is it?</h3>

This is in fact the Chinese Cultural Center (surprisingly, there's a sizeable Asian population in Calgary). It's modeled after the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. At least the roof of it is. I read that workers and craftsmen were imported from China to put the ornate roof together. I didn't, but to really appreciate the complexity of the roof, you'd need to go inside and view it from below.

Directions: Unique structure southeast of Eau Claire Market

<h3>When in doubt, head downtown</h3>

We were unsure where to begin, so we drove around till we decided to stop at a tourist information center at Eau Claire Market. We never did find it, but it turned out Eau Claire was not a bad place to start. It's similar to an American mall, with typical shops, restaurants, food stalls, an IMAX theater, outdoor swimming pools, the usual assortment of characters. It's a good place to relax and recharge the empty stomach that you endure on the long drive here, a problem compounded by the traffic snarls around downtown. It's only a few blocks walk to downtown. Practically next door is the Chinese Cultural Center.

<h3>Don't forget the ginger</h3>

We saw this Vietnamese Canadian restaurant, A Touch of Ginger, in the food court at Eau Claire Market. We didn't expect to see one here, but there it is.
