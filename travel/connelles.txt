<h1>Connelles</h1>
<h3><em>Romantic Connelles</em></h3>

Connelles was our "homebase" in Normandie. Even though it was a tiny morsel of a town, it was no less romantic, thanks in no small part to the fact that it was home to the dramatically named Côte des Deux Amants, the "Coast of Two Lovers". The town snuggles against a gentle bend of the Sein, and is covered in the lushness of gardens and farms.

Our neighbors were mainly English vacationers, who made the short hop across the channel, I suspect, to take a break from the nice English weather. I can't blame them really :)

The Côte des Deux Amants owes its name, as expected, to a lovelorn young couple. I don't remember the exact details, but I am sure your vivid imagination can fill them in :)
